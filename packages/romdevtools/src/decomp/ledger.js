// ledger.js — what "100% decompiled" actually means, measured per dimension.
//
// `progress` reports CPU code honestly and says outright that data and assets
// are not tracked. That is the right kind of honesty and it leaves the real
// question unanswerable: this ROM has 7,238,640 bytes inside `bin` ranges —
// 86.3% of the image — and none of it is code.
//
// TWO NUMBERS ARE BOTH WRONG. "54.4% done" ignores everything that is not CPU
// code. "86.3% undecompiled" is worse: those bin ranges are compressed assets,
// audio banks and microcode, much of which is legitimately shipped as data and
// was never going to become C.
//
// So the ledger refuses to produce one percentage. It reports independent
// dimensions, each with its own denominator and its own acceptance policy, and
// a single roll-up only when the project has declared weights. A number nobody
// defined the meaning of is the thing that lets a mixed build be called a
// finished decompilation.
//
// Range states, weakest to strongest:
//   raw                  bytes, nothing known
//   format-identified    we know what it is
//   round-trip-tool      a tool can unpack AND repack it byte-exactly
//   editable-source      it exists as editable source in the tree
//   semantically-reviewed a human has checked it means what it says
//   policy-retained      deliberately kept as-is (handwritten asm, vendor blobs)
//
// Plain JS ESM + JSDoc.
