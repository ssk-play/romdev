// type-graph.js - project-wide type evidence, not per-function guesses.
//
// `types.js` records what ONE function's asm proves about ONE base register:
// this offset was loaded with lw, that one with lhu. That is real evidence and
// it is stranded. The same struct is passed to a dozen functions, returned from
// another, stored in a global, and walked with a stride in a loop; every one of
// those is evidence about the SAME type, and none of it was being combined.
//
// Real campaign progress comes from exactly that combination - entity node
// banks, controller records, component links, camera state, splines, particle
// arrays. Recovering a layout once should improve every dependent function
// instead of being rediscovered per function.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM. It is an EVIDENCE graph, not a type
// inferencer. Every fact carries where it came from and how strongly it is
// held, conflicts are recorded as conflicts rather than silently resolved by
// last-writer-wins, and a proposal is a proposal until a human or a compare
// accepts it. An inferencer that quietly picked a winner would produce
// confident wrong headers, which is more expensive than no headers.
//
// Plain JS ESM + JSDoc.
