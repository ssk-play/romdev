// replay.js — a public-API replay suite over preserved candidates.
//
// §12 of the 2026-09-15 report: "Build a small, public-API replay suite from
// preserved candidates, using isolated worktrees or fixture snapshots. Do not
// mutate the production checkout or treat already-integrated current C as the
// original assembly fixture."
//
// That second clause is the one that bites. An accepted candidate is already
// in the tree, so re-splicing it into the CURRENT owner yields `redeclaration
// of ...` and a compile failure that looks like the candidate's fault. Every
// case that names an integrated function therefore carries `ownerPath`: the
// pre-integration backup, which is what makes an accepted recovery
// re-verifiable at all.
//
// What this measures, and what it deliberately does not:
//
//   MEASURED    whether each case reproduces its expected outcome, and how
//               long the public call took.
//   NOT CLAIMED any speedup multiple. The report says plainly: "No controlled
//               before/after throughput benchmark has been run. I cannot
//               substantiate a promised 5x or 10x speedup." A suite that
//               invented one would be the same failure it was written to
//               catch. p50/p95 are reported only when there are enough runs.
