// ranking.js - mechanism-aware candidate ranking.
//
// Levenshtein distance is fine for rough triage and must not select late-stage
// winners. A large sweep ranked on one scalar optimises that scalar, and the
// scalar is not the thing you want.
//
// THE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST, and the reason this file exists rather than a
// sort comparator inlined somewhere: **`aligned_total` is only comparable
// between candidates in the SAME gap state.** A gap is an insertion or deletion
// in the aligned instruction stream. Once two candidates differ in how many
// gaps they have, their aligned totals were computed over different alignments
// and comparing them is meaningless - the candidate with more gaps can post a
// lower total precisely because fewer rows lined up to be counted. Ranking a
// mixed set by aligned_total silently prefers the WORSE candidate.
//
// So: candidates are partitioned by gap state. Within a partition, aligned
// metrics rank. Across partitions, the safe fallback ranks, and the response
// says which rule was applied and why.
//
// Plain JS ESM + JSDoc.
