// artifacts.js - content-addressed storage with a retention policy.
//
// This campaign is carrying roughly 2 GB split between research output and the
// romdev workspace: compiler traces, duplicate candidate sources, objects, ROMs
// and logs. Most of it is duplicates - 264 candidate files for one function are
// overwhelmingly the same bytes under different names.
//
// THE ONE RULE THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN. Never prune the only source/object pair
// supporting an accepted or documented conclusion. A campaign's value is its
// evidence; a cache that garbage-collects the proof behind a finding converts
// a settled question into an open one, and the next agent pays to rediscover
// it. So retention is by CLASS, deletion is always dry-run first, and anything
// pinned or referenced by a conclusion is untouchable regardless of age.
//
// Plain JS ESM + JSDoc.
