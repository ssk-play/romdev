// diagnose.js — residual diagnosis that names the COMPILER MECHANISM.
//
// The reporter's complaint (2026-09-15 §5) was precise: classifying a word as
// "a register difference" or "an instruction difference" does not tell you what
// experiment to run. They had to reconstruct the owner TU by hand, recover its
// compile invocation, recompile with `-Wa,-R`, find the relevant nodes in an
// 11,000-line trace, map source lines to nodes, and reason about scheduling
// priorities — for a handful of mismatches.
//
// So this module does three things the per-word classifier does not:
//
//   1. GROUPS residuals that share one cause, instead of listing every affected
//      word as an independent problem. Eleven words of s5/s6/s7 substitution
//      are ONE allocation decision, not eleven.
//   2. Names the MECHANISM per group (scheduling permutation, branch lowering,
//      register assignment, frame layout, instruction-count change, relocation
//      spelling, unclassified) with the evidence that supports it.
//   3. Proposes DISCRIMINATING experiments — each with a prediction and, more
//      importantly, what would REFUTE the hypothesis.
//
// Two rules this file will not break, both stated in the report:
//
//   - "An as1 trace alone must not be claimed to explain uopt decisions."
//     Trace evidence is labelled with the phase it can actually speak for.
//     as1 schedules; it does not choose which expressions exist.
//   - "Report unknown keys rather than fabricating them." A trace field this
//     parser does not understand is surfaced as unknown, never guessed.
