/* ── snes_sfx.c — SPC driver uploader + sfx + music dispatch ────────
 *
 * Direct C port of the apu_upload routine from
 * rom-games/snes/invaders/main.asm. The protocol is well-known but
 * timing-sensitive — every byte transfer requires a handshake with
 * the SPC700 driver, which is why it's spelled out byte-by-byte here.
 *
 * Upload protocol (from Nintendo's "Audio Programming Manual"):
 *   1. Wait for SPC to write $AA $BB into ports 0+1 (its boot ROM
 *      handshake — says "I'm ready"). $2140 = $AA, $2141 = $BB.
 *   2. Write destination ARAM address into ports 2+3 ($2142/$2143).
 *   3. Write $01 to $2141 (kick command).
 *   4. Write $CC to $2140 and wait for SPC to echo it back. Now
 *      we're in upload mode.
 *   5. For each byte: write byte to $2141, write index (mod 256) to
 *      $2140, wait for SPC to echo the index.
 *   6. To finish: write final destination into $2142/$2143, $00 into
 *      $2141, then a "kick+2" command into $2140 telling SPC to
 *      jump to the new code.
 *
 * The driver, once running, watches $F4 (= main side's $2140) and
 * dispatches on edge-detected command changes.
 *
 * R46 update: payload size is now read from the linker-defined
 * `apu_blob_end` symbol so the song table can grow without touching
 * this file. The R46 driver added music engine state + an extra
 * voice config (voice 1), bumping the driver from ~150 to ~230 bytes,
 * and song data lives at ARAM $5000 — so the upload payload jumped
 * from 9240 to ~20 KB.
