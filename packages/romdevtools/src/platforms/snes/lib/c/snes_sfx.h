/* ── snes_sfx.h — minimal SNES sound + music wrapper ────────────────
 *
 * SNES audio = SPC700 (separate CPU + 64 KB ARAM + 8-channel DSP).
 * The 65816 main CPU has NO direct DSP access — it can ONLY talk to
 * the SPC700 via four I/O ports at $2140-$2143 (also known as
 * APUIO0-3 / REG_APU00-03).
 *
 * To make sound on SNES you need TWO things:
 *   1. An SPC driver program (running on the SPC700, in ARAM).
 *   2. Sample data (BRR-encoded) loaded into ARAM where the driver
 *      knows to look for it.
 *
 * This wrapper takes the simpler path: ship a prebuilt "apu_blob"
 * (driver + sample bank + song table) that gets uploaded to ARAM at
 * $0200 during sfx_init(). Then to trigger sound you write a command
 * byte to $2140 and the driver dispatches.
 *
 * Commands (matching the bundled spc_driver.asm):
 *   0 = no-op / release         (call sfx_release between repeats)
 *   1 = play sample 0 (shoot)   — sfx_play(1)
 *   2 = play sample 1 (explosion) — sfx_play(2)
 *   3 = start music              — sfx_music_play()
 *   4 = stop  music              — sfx_music_stop()
 *
 * Voice assignment in the driver:
 *   Voice 0 = sfx slot (one-shot, retriggered on cmds 1/2)
 *   Voice 1 = music melody (driven by the song table walker, retriggers
 *             on each row at the row's pitch)
 *   Voices 2-7 = unused (room to extend the driver with more channels)
 *
 * The driver uses edge-detection on the command byte — to trigger
 * the same command twice in a row you MUST send 0 (release) first
 * then the real command. All wrapper helpers below handle that for you.
 *
 * Music engine details:
 *   - The bundled song is a 16-step C-major-ish arpeggio (4 bars at
 *     ~115 BPM) hand-authored in apu_blob.asm. It loops forever once
 *     sfx_music_play() is called.
 *   - To replace the song, edit apu_blob.asm's `song:` table (each row
 *     is 3 bytes: duration_ticks at 62.5 Hz, pitch_lo, pitch_hi) and
 *     re-run `node scripts/build-apu-blob.js`.
 *
 * Source files alongside this header:
 *   apu_blob.bin        prebuilt SPC driver + sample bank + song
 *   apu_blob.asm        asar source for the whole payload (driver +
 *                       music engine + song table)
 *   spc_driver.asm      reference copy of the driver only
 *   shoot.brr           BRR-encoded "shoot" sample (also used as the
 *                       instrument waveform for music voice 1)
 *   explosion.brr       BRR-encoded "explosion" sample
 *   sample_bank.bin     directory + samples assembled together

/* Upload the bundled SPC driver + sample bank + song table into ARAM

 * ⚠ CALL THIS *AFTER* setScreenOn(), AND CHECK THE RETURN. Every wait
 * inside is bounded — a wedged SPC can no longer hang the main CPU — but

 * running (the game renders fine without sound). Calling it BEFORE the
 * screen is on, or spinning on it, is the classic "black screen, OAM
 * stays zero, video never starts" footgun.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success; nonzero = failed (sound unavailable, keep going):
 *   1 = SPC boot handshake timed out (weird SPC state from a prior run)
 *   2 = kick-command echo timed out
 *   3 = byte-transfer echo timed out (mid-upload)
 *   4 = jump-command echo timed out */
