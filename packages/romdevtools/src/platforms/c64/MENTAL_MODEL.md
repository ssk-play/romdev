# Commodore 64 — mental model

One page. Read once before you write your first C64 game. The
TROUBLESHOOTING.md alongside this file is for when something's broken.

The C64 is the architectural outlier of romdev's 6502-class platforms.
It has KERNAL + BASIC ROMs always available (and your code can call
them or override them), 64 KB of contiguous RAM with bank-switching to
get under the I/O area, two CIAs for I/O, and a VIC-II that doesn't
think in "tiles" — it thinks in **character cells**.

## CPU memory map (6510 — a 6502 with a tiny I/O port)

```
$0000-$0001   6510 internal I/O — bank-switch control
$0002-$00FF   zero page
$0100-$01FF   stack
$0200-$03FF   KERNAL+BASIC scratch / vectors (rarely touch directly)
$0400-$07E7   default screen RAM (40×25 char matrix)
$07E8-$07FF   sprite pointers ($07F8-$07FF = 8 bytes, one per MOB)
$0800-$9FFF   user RAM (cc65 puts code + data here for typical .prg)
$A000-$BFFF   BASIC ROM (banked; RAM underneath)
$C000-$CFFF   RAM (no ROM overlay)
$D000-$D3FF   VIC-II registers (banked; CHAREN bit selects)
$D400-$D7FF   SID registers
$D800-$DBE7   color RAM (1 KB nibble RAM — low 4 bits hold color index)
$DC00-$DC0F   CIA1 (keyboard, joystick, timers)
$DD00-$DD0F   CIA2 (serial, VIC bank select, user port)
$E000-$FFFF   KERNAL ROM (banked; RAM underneath)
```

The 6510's I/O port at `$0001` selects which ROMs are visible:

```
bit 0 (LORAM):  1 = BASIC ROM visible at $A000
bit 1 (HIRAM):  1 = KERNAL ROM visible at $E000
bit 2 (CHAREN): 0 = char ROM at $D000, 1 = I/O regs visible
```

Default after boot = `$37` (all three set) — BASIC + KERNAL ROMs +
I/O regs. Set CHAREN=0 to read the character-set bitmaps from ROM;
set HIRAM=0 to swap KERNAL out for RAM (useful for low-memory tricks).

> **cc65 zero-page starts at $02 (same cc65 trap as NES/Atari/Lynx).** cc65
> reserves `$00-$01` (here it's also the 6510 I/O port), so your first
> `.res 1` in `ZEROPAGE` lands at **$02**, not $00. Don't hand-write asm that
> assumes a ZP var is at $00. Confirm with `symbols({op:'map'})` after
> `build({output:'romWithDebug'})`.

## VIC-II — character cells, NOT tiles

The C64's video chip displays 25 rows × 40 cols of 8×8 character
glyphs. Each cell:

- Screen RAM ($0400) holds the **character code** (0-255).
- Color RAM ($D800) holds the **color index** (0-15) for that cell.
  Color RAM is nibble RAM — only the low 4 bits are wired up.
- The character set itself is at $D000 (ROM) or wherever VIC's char
  base register points (`VIC_MEMORY` at $D018).

Two character sets in ROM:
- "Uppercase + graphics": chars $00-$3F = uppercase letters + symbols
- "Lowercase + uppercase": chars $00-$3F = lowercase + UPPERCASE shifted

You can also point VIC at custom character RAM and write your own
glyphs (this is how every published C64 game does its art).

## VIC-II screen modes

```
text         default — 40×25 cells × 8×8 chars, 16 colors per cell
multicolor   half-res horizontal (40×25 cells, but 4-color cells with shared MC1/MC2)
hires bitmap 320×200 pixels, 2 colors per 8×8 cell
multi bitmap 160×200 pixels, 4 colors per 8×8 cell
```

Most C64 games use either text mode with a custom char set (cheap +
fast) or multicolor bitmap (more detail but harder to update).

## VIC-II sprites (MOBs)

8 hardware sprites, each:
- 24×21 pixels (3 bytes/row × 21 rows = 63 bytes; allocated in 64-byte
  slots so the leftover byte is unused padding)
- Stored in the VIC's current 16 KB **bank** (default $0000-$3FFF)
- Located via the **sprite pointer** at $07F8+N: pointer value × 64 =
  byte address WITHIN the bank
- Position: `VIC_SPRITE_X(N)` / `VIC_SPRITE_Y(N)` are 8-bit; X high
  bits live in `VIC_SPRITES_X8` at $D010 (for X >= 256)
- Color: `VIC_SPR_COL(N)` at $D027+N (single-color sprites)
- Enable: bit N of `VIC_SPR_ENA` at $D015

Sprite Y is offset 50 px from the screen's top edge; sprite X is
offset 24 px from the left edge. So `VIC_SPRITE_Y = 50` puts the
sprite at the visible top-left.

## CIA1 — joysticks + keyboard

CIA1 at $DC00-$DC0F. The chip is dual-purpose:
- $DC00 (CIA1_PRA): joystick PORT 2 + keyboard column select
- $DC01 (CIA1_PRB): joystick PORT 1 + keyboard row read

Joystick bits (active LOW — pressed = 0, released = 1):
```
bit 0: UP    bit 1: DOWN   bit 2: LEFT
bit 3: RIGHT bit 4: FIRE
```

**Convention:** read joystick from PORT 2 (CIA1_PRA) unless you have
a specific reason not to. Reading PRB clashes with keyboard scanning,
which is what the KERNAL's IRQ uses to update key state every
1/60 sec — you'd get garbled input from your jiffy timer.

### Driving input over MCP

**Joystick.** One fire button. Press it with `input({op:'set', b: true})` (or
spatial `south`) — both clear `$DC00` bit 4 (verified live). `a` is a **no-op**
(no second button). Drive fire with `b`/`south` + the d-pad.

**Two players.** BOTH C64 control ports are live at once, so 2P games just work:
**host port 0 = player 1** (control port 2, `$DC00`) and **host port 1 = player
2** (control port 1, `$DC01`) — the universal "port 0 = P1" convention. Pass two
port entries: `input({op:'set', ports:[{up:true}, {down:true}]})` moves P1 up and
P2 down independently. (Under the hood the host enables the VICE userport-adapter
mapping so both ports route, and swaps them so P1 lands on control port 2 where
the games read it.) The legacy `input({op:'joyport', joyport:1|2})` still selects
which single port a ONE-stick setup drives, but you rarely need it now.

**Keyboard (the C64-specific part — many games NEED it).** Unlike consoles, most
C64 games (and cracktros) gate gameplay behind a KEYBOARD setup screen — **F1**
to pick 1 player, RUN/STOP, SPACE/RETURN — that the joystick can't reach. So if a
joystick gets you to a title/intro but not into play, you almost certainly need a
key:
- `input({op:'pressKey', key:'f1'})` — press one C64 key (held + auto-released).
  Keys: `f1/f3/f5/f7`, `return`, `space`, `run/stop`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `ctrl`, `cbm`,
  `home`, `down`, `right`, `lshift`, `rshift`.
- `input({op:'typeText', text:'LOAD"*",8,1\rRUN\r'})` — type a string (`\r` =
  RETURN). For BASIC commands / filenames.
- `input({op:'layout', platform:'c64'})` lists the keyboard keys + the joyport.

A typical C64 RE startup: load → step to the title → `pressKey f1` (1 player) →
`set {b:true}` (fire to start) → step → you're in gameplay → `state({op:'save'})`.

**Script the whole startup in one call.** `recordSession`'s `inputScript` takes
C64 `keys` alongside joystick `ports` — held from each entry until the next — so a
key+joystick startup is one deterministic timeline instead of many calls:
```js
recordSession({ frames:600, sampleEvery:60, outputDir:'…', inputScript:[
  { atFrame:0,  keys:['f1'] },        // 1 player
  { atFrame:30, ports:[{ b:true }] }, // fire (port 2)
  { atFrame:90, keys:['run/stop'] },  // start
  { atFrame:120, keys:[] } ] })       // release
```
A step may set just `keys`, just `ports`, or both; `keys:[]` releases all. An
unknown key is rejected with a clear error (not a silent no-op).

**When a key seems ignored, probe it.** `input({op:'pressKey', key:'run/stop',
verify:true})` returns the matrix coords, active joyport, and a CIA1 snapshot
(`$DC00`/`$DC01`) **before / during (held) / after**. `before==during` ⇒ the key
never moved the matrix line (didn't reach VICE); they differ but the game didn't
react ⇒ it scanned a different key/port, or that screen (crack/doc/trainer)
ignores it. This is how you tell a romdev problem from a game-flow problem.

**Controller-alone (playtest):** a human in `playtest` needs no keyboard — the
pad's spare buttons map to the C64 keys (X=Space, L2=Run/Stop, R2=Return,
right-stick=F1/F3/F5/F7, top face=F1; d-pad+Fire=joystick). The same mapping
applies to the agent's `setInput`, so e.g. `input({op:'set', c64_f1:true})` also
presses F1. `playtest({op:'open'})` returns `c64Controls` to relay to the user.

⚠ A cc65 `.prg` only starts after BASIC auto-`RUN`s it — step ~70+ frames past
load before input/reads register.

## SID — three voices of fame

Three voices at $D400-$D418. Per-voice:
- 16-bit frequency (`SID_FREQ_LO/HI`)
- 12-bit pulse-width (for the pulse waveform)
- Control byte: gate / sync / ring / test / wave-select (triangle / saw /
  pulse / noise)
- 16-bit ADSR envelope (`SID_AD`, `SID_SR`)

Global `SID_VOL_MODE` ($D418) holds master volume + filter routing
bits. SID is famous for sounding incredible with very little code — see
the `sid_play.s` starter snippet.

**Debugging sound:** `audioDebug({op:'inspect', chip:"sid"})` decodes all 3 voices live —
waveform, freq→note, pulse-width, ADSR — plus the filter cutoff/resonance/mode.
Handy for verifying a `sid_play` routine is actually gating notes.

## MCP debug & inspection tooling

romdev runs the C64 on a patched VICE (`vice_x64`) core that exposes deep live
state. The inspectors all read the **running** machine — use them to confirm what
your code actually did to the hardware, not what you think it did.

**Live visual / state inspectors:**

- `palette({source:'live'})` — the 16-color hardware-fixed C64 palette as a PNG,
  plus the current border / background / extra-background color indices decoded
  straight from the VIC-II registers.
- `sprites({op:'inspect'})` — all 8 MOBs decoded into the generic sprite shape:
  X/Y, color, multicolor flag, expand-X / expand-Y, priority, AND the screen-RAM
  sprite-data pointers at `$07F8` so you can locate each sprite's pixel block in
  the VIC bank.
- `cpu({op:'read'})` — the 6510 registers (A/X/Y/P/SP/PC) read from a live,
  `#define`-aliased register file, plus the `$0001` I/O port decoded into its
  LORAM / HIRAM / CHAREN bits (so you can see which ROMs are banked in).
- `background({view:'renderState'})` — the VIC-II registers decoded into
  mode / scroll / colors / sprites, the VIC bank resolved from CIA2 `$DD00`, and
  the **absolute** screen-RAM + character-base addresses (no manual bank math).
- `audioDebug({op:'inspect', chip:'sid'})` — the SID voice/filter decode covered
  in the SID section above.

**`c64_*` memory regions** (via `memory({op:'read'})`) — exact, named windows
onto the hardware, decoded live:

| region          | size  | notes                                           |
| --------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `system_ram`    | 64 KB | full RAM                                         |
| `c64_color_ram` | 1 KB  | the nibble color RAM                            |
| `c64_vic_regs`  | 64 B  | VIC-II registers                                |
| `c64_sid_regs`  | 29 B  | SID registers (read via `sid_peek`)             |
| `c64_cia1_regs` | 16 B  | CIA1, from the `c_cia[]` array                  |
| `c64_cia2_regs` | 16 B  | CIA2, from the `c_cia[]` array                  |
| `c64_cpu_regs`  | 7 B   | 6510 register file                              |

**Disassembly:** `disasm({target:'rom'})` and `disasm({target:'references'})`
accept `.prg` files (they understand the 2-byte little-endian load-address
header), and apply the C64 register-annotation table so VIC-II / SID / CIA
register accesses come back named rather than as bare addresses.

**Starter snippets** cover `vic_init` / `sprite_table` / `sid_play` /
`read_joystick` / `basic_stub`.

Disk-image loading and disk SAVE/restore tooling have their own sections below
("Disk images" and "Disk SAVES").

## Cartridge / load file format

The .prg format is dead simple:
- First 2 bytes = little-endian load address
- Rest = data, loaded sequentially into RAM starting at that address

cc65 produces .prg files with the load address set to $0801 (BASIC
start) so they can be `LOAD"*",8,1` / `RUN` from a BASIC prompt. The
KERNAL handles the load; your code runs from the cc65-generated BASIC
stub that does a `SYS` to the C entry point.

For game ROMs you typically just let the user load the .prg into the
emulator and the rest takes care of itself.

## Disk images (.d64) — loading real games & distributing yours

A bare `.prg` is fine for dev iteration, but the real C64 world — the new
Commodore 64 Ultimate / C64C Ultimate FPGA hardware and the homebrew/demo
scene — ships and loads games as **`.d64` disk images** (and `.crt` carts /
`.tap` tapes). romdev handles them:

- **Load & run a disk/cart/tape:** `loadMedia({platform:'c64', path:'game.d64'})`
  (also `.t64 .tap .crt .g64`). VICE attaches it to drive 8 and **autostarts**
  it (equivalent to `LOAD"*",8,1 : RUN`) under warp — give it a few hundred
  frames to finish the emulated 1541 load, then it's running. `mediaKind` in
  status reports `disk` / `tape` / `cartridge` / `program` so you know what you
  loaded.
- **Distribute YOUR game as a disk:** build your `.prg` as usual, then
  `cart({op:'packDisk', prgPath:'game.prg'})` → an autostart-able `game.d64`
  in the exact format the Ultimate hardware and the scene load. (`cart({op:
  'extract', path:'x.d64'})` lists a disk's files; add `name:` to pull one out.)

## Disk SAVES (the C64 save medium)

The C64 has no battery SRAM — games save by **writing files to the floppy**. The
disk IS the save, so romdev exposes the LIVE mounted `.d64` for save/restore
(the C64 analogue of SRAM `exportSram`/`importSram`):

- **Snapshot the disk** (captures any files the game wrote): `state({op:
  'exportDisk', path:'save.d64'})`. Re-load it later with `loadMedia` (autostarts)
  or push it back into a running session with `state({op:'importDisk', path})`.
- **Inject a save file** a player made elsewhere, straight into the running disk:
  `state({op:'putDiskFile', path:'progress.prg', name:'PROGRESS'})` writes one PRG
  file via the drive. Read it back with `exportDisk` or `cart({op:'extract'})`.

These work on the standard 35-track 1541 `.d64` (174848 bytes).

**A game's OWN in-emulator `SAVE` works too.** When a running program does a
KERNAL `SAVE` to drive 8, VICE commits it into the live disk image (true-drive
GCR write-back) — so after the game saves, `state({op:'exportDisk', path})`
captures a `.d64` that includes the new file, and you can re-load it later to
resume. (The on-disk filename is stored in PETSCII; romdev's reader decodes it.)
So the normal flow is just: run the game, let it save, `exportDisk` to persist.
`putDiskFile`/`importDisk` are for *injecting* a save from outside (a save a
player made elsewhere), not a requirement for the game's own saves.

## Frame heartbeat

The C64 has no dedicated vblank interrupt by default. Two approaches:

1. **Poll VIC_RASTER** ($D012): waits for the raster to reach line 250+
   (off the bottom of the visible region) — gives you a reliable per-
   frame tick. This is what the bundled `hello_sprite` and `tile_engine`
   templates do.
2. **Raster interrupt**: program VIC_RASTER + IRQ_ENA to fire an IRQ
   at a specific line. More complex; required for tricks like
   mid-screen mode changes, multiplexed sprites, etc.

## Build pipeline

When you call `build({output:'rom', platform:"c64", language:"c"})`:

1. cc65 compiles your `.c` → 6502 `.s`.
2. ca65 assembles each `.s` → `.o`.
3. ld65 links + the bundled c64.cfg → `.prg` with a 2-byte load-address
   header.

Loadable via vice_x64 (`loadMedia`). To ship it the way the scene/hardware
loads games, wrap the `.prg` into a `.d64`: `cart({op:'packDisk', prgPath})`
(see "Disk images" above).

## Horizontal scrolling (for side-scrollers)

The `platformer` example is single-screen. C64 scrolling is the fiddliest of
the platforms because the VIC-II only does a 0-7 px *fine* scroll in hardware;
moving further is a software char-cell shift.

- **Fine scroll:** the low 3 bits of `$D016` set a 0-7 px horizontal offset.
  To hide the garbage column that the fine scroll exposes at the edge, switch
  to 38-column mode (clear `$D016` bit 3) which masks the side borders.
- **Coarse scroll:** when the fine offset wraps past 7, reset it to 0 and
  shift the whole **screen RAM** ($0400) AND **color RAM** ($D800) left by one
  char column, then fill the new rightmost column from your world map. This is
  ~1000+1000 byte moves — do it across the frame or with the screen split.
- **Smoothness:** update `$D016` early in the frame (e.g. a raster IRQ) so the
  fine offset is set before the visible area is drawn.

Track `camX` in pixels: `fine = camX & 7` → `$D016`; `coarseCol = camX >> 3`
indexes your world map for which columns are on screen.

## Reverse-engineering & decompilation

The Rizin/Ghidra analysis engine works here like everywhere: `disasm({target:'functions'})` to carve the program, `disasm({target:'cfg'|'xrefs'})` to trace it, `symbols({op:'analyze'})` for a one-shot structural map.

**Decompiler quality on 6502: ROUGH.** Carry-flag idioms and 16-bit math on an 8-bit CPU decompile to noise that only reads cleanly once an LLM folds it — on this CPU the disassembly is often more honest than the pseudocode. `disasm({target:'decompile', address})` returns C-like pseudocode (the `qualityNote` field restates this). Read it to UNDERSTAND a routine; use `disasm({target:'project'})` to actually edit + rebuild. See the cross-platform ROM-hacking playbook §5f for the full loop.
