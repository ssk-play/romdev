// Report 2026-09-15 §13: "the stale installed skill cannot be regenerated
// using the remedy returned by decomp({op:'skill'}) itself" -- and, found
// while fixing that: a skill whose VERSION matches the server can still
// document none of the ops the server ships.
//
// Comparing version strings alone reported `stale: false` on a document that
// mentioned none of five newly shipped ops. A skill that never names an op is
// a skill that stops an agent from using it, which is exactly the failure the
// staleness check exists to prevent.
