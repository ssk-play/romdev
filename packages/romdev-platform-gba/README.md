# romdev-platform-gba

Game Boy Advance bundle: mGBA emulator core + arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain
(cc1/as/ld/objcopy/objdump) — the objdump also powers ARM/Thumb `disassembleRom` +
byte-exact `disassembleProject` — as WebAssembly.

A binary package for [romdev](https://github.com/monteslu/romdev) — it ships the
prebuilt WebAssembly + JS glue and is resolved by the main `romdev` package on
demand. You normally install `romdev`, not this package directly.

## Upstream & license

Bundles: **mGBA, arm-none-eabi-gcc**.

**License:** mGBA: MPL-2.0. arm-none-eabi-gcc/binutils: GPL-3.0 with GCC Runtime Library Exception (does not encumber compiled ROMs).

This package redistributes the upstream binary built to WebAssembly; the source
is fetched from a pinned upstream commit at build time (see the romdev repo's
`scripts/versions.json` and `BUILDING.md`). See the romdev repo `NOTICE` for the
full third-party inventory.
