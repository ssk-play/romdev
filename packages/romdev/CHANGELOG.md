# Changelog

All notable changes to `romdev-mcp`. Dates are release dates.

## 0.4.0

Native disassemblers across the board, GBA disassembly + byte-exact projects
unlocked, and smarter cheat search. Disassembly is now byte-exact on **all 14
platforms** — `disassembleRom`, `findReferences`, and `disassembleProject` all run
through native tools end to end, no hand-rolled JS de/encoders left anywhere.

### Changed — native binutils disassemblers replace ALL the hand-rolled ones
Every hand-rolled JS instruction decoder (m68k / z80 / sm83) is **deleted** and
replaced by **native GNU binutils `objdump` compiled to WASM** — the same binutils
we already build per toolchain, now shipping `objdump` alongside
`as`/`ld`/`objcopy`. The JS decoders dropped real instructions and (on m68k)
desynced the byte stream into garbage — the "useless binary" a Genesis RE session
hit. There is **no JS fallback** — the native path is the only path.
- **m68k (Genesis)** → `m68k-elf-objdump`. The JS decoder dropped move-sr / muls /
  divu and mis-sized the fallback; a real ROM now disassembles cleanly.
- **Z80 (SMS / Game Gear / MSX)** → binutils z80 `objdump` `-m z80` (fixes the
  (ix+d)/(iy+d) displacement display + edge cases).
- **SM83 (Game Boy / Color)** → the same z80-elf `objdump` via its `gbz80` machine.
  One z80-elf binutils serves both CPU families.
- **ARM/Thumb (GBA)** → `arm-none-eabi-objdump`.

### Added
- **GBA disassembly** (the 14th platform, previously rejected) — `disassembleRom`
  and `findReferences` disassemble ARM7/Thumb via native `arm-none-eabi-objdump`
  (ARM by default, `thumb:true` for Thumb code).
- **`disassembleProject` now covers all 14 platforms, GBA included.** Each region
  disassembles through the CPU's native objdump and reassembles **byte-exact**
  through the matching native `as`/`ld`/`objcopy` (cc65 ca65/ld65 for 6502/65816).
  Any line the assembler won't reproduce exactly is healed to a `.byte` of its real
  bytes, so the round-trip is always byte-for-byte. The GBA project splits a 192-byte
  header data region from an ARM code region; it rebuilds byte-exact but reads low
  (most GBA C is Thumb reached via an ARM crt0 stub — ARM/Thumb mode-tracking is the
  readability follow-up).
- **Lynx** wired into `disassembleRom` + `findReferences` (65C02 via da65; strips the
  64-byte LYNX header, anchors at $0200).
- **Cheat search** now uses `fuse.js` over tag-stripped game names — adds
  character-level typo tolerance on top of the existing region/revision-tag and
  word-order robustness.

### Internal
- Native binutils 2.42 is built to WASM for THREE targets — `m68k-elf`,
  `arm-none-eabi`, and `z80-elf` (one serves both Z80 and gbz80) — each shipping
  `as`/`ld`/`objcopy`/`objdump`. Reproducible build scripts under `scripts/`
  (`build-m68k-wasm-tools.sh`, `build-arm-wasm-tools.sh`, `build-z80-binutils-wasm.sh`),
  pins in `scripts/versions.json`.
- Bumped binary packages this release: `romdev-toolchain-m68k-gcc` 0.2.0 (+ objdump),
  `romdev-platform-gba` 0.3.0 (+ ARM objdump), `romdev-toolchain-sdcc` 0.2.0
  (+ z80-elf binutils).

## 0.3.1

Homebrew/asset-import polish from a Genesis platformer session, plus a Genesis
sprite-inspection bug fix.

### Added
- **`wavToXgm2Pcm`** — convert a WAV (or raw s16le PCM) into a Genesis XGM2 PCM
  sample: 8-bit signed mono, 13.3 kHz (or 6.65 half-rate), 256-byte-padded, plus a
  256-aligned C array + `<NAME>_LEN` define ready to `#include` and `XGM2_playPCM`.
  Bakes in the fiddly sign/rate/alignment/padding rules.
- **`convertImageToTiles`** now takes `pngPath` (reads the PNG from disk — no base64
  token cost or hand-forwarding corruption) and `tileOrder:'sprite'` (column-major,
  the order multi-cell hardware sprites read on Genesis/Lynx).

### Changed
- **`imageToTilemap`** (Genesis) now warns when a visible dominant color is forced
  to palette index 0 (transparent on a scroll plane → renders as the backdrop).
- **`recordAudio`** description now cross-references `getAudioState` (WAV is to
  HEAR; getAudioState is to ASSERT), and notes getAudioState doesn't cover Genesis
  PCM-channel activity yet. Genesis MENTAL_MODEL documents the XGM2 PCM rules.

### Fixed
- **Genesis `inspectSprites` size/position** — a 32×32 sprite decoded as 8×8 (and
  x/y/tile/palette could be wrong) because the SAT words were read big-endian;
  gpgx stores VRAM host-little-endian (byte-swapped). Fixed in the live sprite,
  plane-preview, and which-tiles decoders.

## 0.3.0

The reverse-engineering / romhacking release — a full RE toolkit driven by a real
NBA Jam Tournament Edition (Genesis) session, plus PC Engine + MSX cheat coverage
and a cleaner package split.

### Added — RE / romhacking toolkit
- **`searchValue` / `searchNext`** — the iterative value-search loop (Cheat-Engine
  / RetroArch cheat search): seed candidate addresses for an on-screen value, then
  narrow with `eq`/`gt`/`lt`/`changed`/`unchanged`/`inc`/`dec` as the value changes.
  The bread-and-butter "find the address of X" primitive. Works on all 14 platforms.
- **`readCartRom`** — read the loaded cartridge ROM image to confirm a patch is
  actually running. For un-banked platforms (Genesis, GB/GBC, SMS/GG, PCE, Lynx,
  Atari, C64) a file offset equals the CPU ROM address; NES/SNES skip the header
  and flag `mapped:true` (bytes correct, mapper-banked).
- **`classifyRegion`** — heuristic ("looks like ascii-text / high-entropy /
  tile-data / structured-data") that flags when a "found table" is really an ASCII
  string, killing the coincidental-match trap before a broken patch ships.
- **`navigate`** — drive menus by advancing on SCREEN CHANGE instead of fixed frame
  waits, reporting per-press whether it was `consumed`. 5–10× faster, deterministic
  menu scripting.
- **`traceVramSource`** (Genesis) — report which ROM offset a VRAM graphic was DMA'd
  from (decoded from the VDP DMA registers). Answers "this name/logo is a
  pre-rendered bitmap — where in ROM is it?".
- **`searchCheats`** — fuzzy game-name search over the cheat DB (no full-DB dump).
- **ROM-hacking playbook** — cross-platform RE/patching decision tree, readable via
  `getPlatformDoc({platform:'romhacking', name:'playbook'})`.

### Added — platforms / data
- **PC Engine** and **MSX** cheat-database coverage (397 + 377 games).
- **`romdev_game_codes`** — the cheat database is now its own package (lazy-loaded one
  platform at a time), shrinking the main package while letting the DB grow
  independently. Still a required dependency, so `npx romdev-mcp` ships with cheats.

### Changed
- **`learnFontMap`** now detects and reports pre-rendered tile graphics
  (`likelyPreRenderedGraphic`) instead of failing silently on non-font "text".
- **`diffMemory`** defaults to a clustered summary (changed ranges + stride
  detection — "islands at stride 0x80 ⇒ likely a struct array") instead of dumping
  thousands of per-byte rows; `view:'raw'` for the exact list.
- **`findWriter` / `watchMemory`** now hint, on no per-byte write, that the region
  may be bulk-copied/DMA'd (sprite shadow, display list, VRAM) — watch the source
  struct, not the destination.
- **`screenshot`** with `inline:true` now also writes a temp PNG and returns its
  path, so follow-up ImageMagick crops don't ENOENT.
- **`gameCheats`** fuzzy-matches a ROM name to the DB (region/revision tag tolerant).

### Fixed
- **Genesis CRAM color decode** — colors rendered blue-on-black; the decoder now
  reads the packed 9-bit little-endian CRAM correctly.

## 0.2.0

- PC Engine and MSX added as Tier-1 platforms (14 total).
- Server/livestream show the version, sourced from `package.json`.
