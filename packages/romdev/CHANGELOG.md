# Changelog

All notable changes to `romdev-mcp`. Dates are release dates.

## 0.6.0

Reverse-engineering round 2 — the tools that collapse the two walls a real
romhack hits: **compressed assets** and **finding the unknown routine**. All on
**all 14 platforms** (every CPU family), feature-detected with clean `notSupported`
where a core can't. Requires the bumped core packages.

### Added — drive the ROM's own code (item 1)
- **`callSubroutine({ pc, regs, sandbox })`** — set up the CPU (registers by reg-id,
  PC) and run a subroutine until it returns, then read back what it produced.
  Sandboxed (snapshot+restore) by default. The general RE primitive.
- **`decompressWith({ entryPC, sourceAddress, destAddress })`** — thin wrapper for
  the decompressor shape (A0=src/A1=dst). Run the game's OWN codec and `readMemory`
  the output — instead of reimplementing an undocumented LZ format. The codec wall,
  gone.
- **`setRegister({ regId, value })`** — write a CPU register (inverse of getCPUState).
  Per-CPU reg-id conventions (m68k 0-7=D,8-15=A,16=PC,18=SP; 6502 0=A,1=X,2=Y,3=P,
  4=SP,16=PC; SM83/Z80 0=A,1=F,2-7=BCDEHL,16=PC,18=SP; 65816 +5=DB,6=D; ARM 0-15=
  r0-r15,16=CPSR). The host's `callSubroutine` knows each CPU's stack discipline
  (page-stack vs predecrement, return width, the 6502/65816 RTS+1 quirk, ARM
  pipeline flush), so it drives routines correctly on every core, not just Genesis.

### Added — discovery (item 2)
- **`watchRange({ start, end, kind })`** — log EVERY read/write hitting an address
  range (not stop-on-first) as `{pc,address,value}`, with a `distinctPCs` summary.
  The fix for "I don't know which PC touches this" — watch the whole pool and SEE
  the routine instead of probing single addresses.
- **`logPCRange({ start, end, frames })`** — coverage trace: every DISTINCT PC that
  executed in a window. FIND an unknown renderer by seeing what runs, not guessing.

### Added — targeted DMA (item 3, Genesis)
- **`watchDma({ vramDest })`** — every mem→VDP DMA with its VRAM destination + ROM
  source + length. "Which DMA wrote the tile at VRAM 0xNNNN, and from where?" — the
  precise version of `traceVramSource`, the way to catch a DMA'd (not CPU-written)
  name/portrait bitmap. Genesis-only (VDP DMA); `notSupported` elsewhere.

### Also
- **PC Engine (geargrafx) gained a write watchpoint** — so `findWriter` +
  `watchRange`-write now work there too (round 1 had read-watch + breakpoint only).

## 0.5.0

Execution breakpoints — the RE primitive that turns "infer for hours" into "read
the register." Adds `runUntilPC`, `runUntilRead`, and `stepInstruction`, live on
**all 14 platforms**. Same model as the write watchpoint; requires the bumped core
packages (gpgx, fceumm, gambatte, prosystem, geargrafx, bluemsx, handy, vice,
platform-snes, platform-atari2600, platform-gba).

### Added — PC breakpoint + read watchpoint + single-step (all 14 platforms)
The symmetric gaps next to `findWriter` (a core-level WRITE watchpoint), requested
by an agent who could disassemble a name-decoder but couldn't read the one address
register that held the answer. Every bundled CPU family now has it:
- **m68k** Genesis (gpgx), **6502/65C02** NES (fceumm) · Atari 2600 (stella) ·
  Atari 7800 (prosystem) · Lynx (handy), **SM83** GB/GBC (gambatte), **65816** SNES
  (snes9x), **Z80** SMS/GG (gpgx) · MSX (bluemsx), **HuC6280** PC Engine (geargrafx),
  **ARM7TDMI** GBA (mgba), **6510** C64 (vice).
- Each core gains the same `romdev_pcbreak_*` / `romdev_readwatch_*` exports (the
  gpgx m68k patch is the template); the host + MCP layer is core-agnostic and
  feature-detects, returning `notSupported` on any core that lacks the exports.
- Single-step is a per-instruction countdown so it ADVANCES the PC; on a hit the
  core consumes its frame cycle budget (PC frozen) so `retro_run` still completes —
  no mid-frame hang.
- **PC Engine caveat (fixed in 0.6.0):** at 0.5.0 geargrafx had no write
  watchpoint, so `findWriter` was unavailable there (the breakpoint tools worked).
  0.6.0 adds the write watchpoint to geargrafx, so `findWriter` works on PC Engine
  too — all 14 platforms now.
- **`runUntilPC({address, maxFrames, pressDuring})`** — runs until the m68k PC
  reaches `address`, then STOPS with the CPU frozen EXACTLY at that instruction
  (the core's execute loop bails mid-frame on the hit). Then `getCPUState` reads
  the full register file at that precise moment — e.g. break at a decoder's
  `move.b (a0),d0` and read `A0` to get the source pointer in one shot.
- **`runUntilRead({address, ...})`** — the read-side mirror of `findWriter`:
  returns the EXACT instruction PC that READ a watched address (find who *consumes*
  a value, not just who writes it).
- **`stepInstruction()`** — CPU-level single-step (finer than `stepFrames`); pair
  with `getCPUState` to watch registers change one instruction at a time.
- All three feature-detect per core and return `notSupported` where the core lacks
  the patch. Genesis is wired now; the gpgx m68k patch (`romdev_pcbreak_*` /
  `romdev_readwatch_*`) is the template for the remaining cores.

### Fixed
- `build-genesis-plus-gx.sh` now stages the rebuilt core into BOTH `src/cores/wasm`
  AND the `romdev-core-gpgx` package (which the registry actually resolves at
  runtime) — a rebuild no longer silently loads the old package copy.

## 0.4.1

Fixes inverted controller-button mapping on the three genesis_plus_gx platforms
(Genesis, SMS, Game Gear), backed by a **full empirical 14-platform input audit**.
Pure `romdev-mcp` patch — no toolchain/core packages changed.

### Fixed — genesis_plus_gx face-button aliases were inverted
genesis_plus_gx maps the console's printed face buttons onto libretro ids in a
non-obvious order, and romdev's native-button aliases + docs had it backwards.
Verified empirically against the running core (an SGDK / port-$DC probe driven by
each libretro button):
- **Genesis**: A/B/C map to libretro **y/b/a** — so `setInput({a:true})` presses
  Genesis **C**, and Genesis A (SGDK `BUTTON_A`) is `setInput({y:true})` /
  `{west:true}`. `pressButton({button:'c'})` resolved to libretro `y` (Genesis A!);
  now resolves to `a` (Genesis C).
- **SMS / Game Gear**: button 1 (TL) = libretro **b**, button 2 (TR) = libretro
  **a** — so `setInput({a:true})` presses button 2. `pressButton({button:'1'/'2'})`
  resolved to `a`/`b`; now `b`/`a`.
- The **spatial face-button names are correct** on all of these (east/south/west
  resolve to the right physical button) — prefer them, or `pressButton`'s native
  aliases, over raw libretro a/b/x/y.
- This was an agent-reported bug: an SGDK platformer's jump (BUTTON_A) wouldn't
  fire headlessly because every "reasonable" libretro guess pressed the wrong
  button.

### Verified — all 14 platforms probed live (so we KNOW the scope)
Each platform got a hardware-register probe ROM driven by each libretro button.
Result: the press-inversion is **exactly the three genesis_plus_gx platforms**
(Genesis/SMS/GG). Every other core maps `setInput({a})`→A correctly:
**NES** (fceumm), **GB/GBC** (gambatte), **SNES** (snes9x — a/b/x/y/l/r all
correct), **GBA** (mGBA), **PC Engine** (geargrafx — a=I, b=II), **MSX** (bluemsx
— a=trigger 1, b=trigger 2), **Lynx** (handy — a=A, b=B, active-high). **C64**
(vice) and **Atari 2600** (stella) are single-fire — fire registers via `b`/`south`,
`a` is a correct no-op.

### Changed — docs
- `getInputLayout` notes for genesis/sms/gg corrected (they previously claimed
  libretro `a` = Genesis A / SMS button 1 — both wrong).
- **Atari 7800** `getInputLayout` note corrected: it had the ProLine INPT register
  numbers swapped (claimed a→INPT1/b→INPT0; the audit + prosystem source confirm
  **a→INPT0 (right/button 2), b→INPT1 (left/button 1)**). The right/left semantic
  was already right, so button presses were unaffected — only register-by-number
  reads were misled. Also documents the default 1-button boot mode (both fires read
  INPT4 until 2-button mode is enabled via CTLSWB).
- `setInput` / `pressButton` descriptions now surface the face-button-naming trap
  at the callsite and point to spatial names / `getInputLayout().faceButtons`.
- `stepFrames` / `screenshot` descriptions nudge toward `stepAndScreenshot` for
  the drive-then-look loop (token-saving).

## 0.4.0

Native disassemblers across the board, GBA disassembly + byte-exact projects
unlocked, and smarter cheat search. Disassembly is now byte-exact on **all 14
platforms** — `disassembleRom`, `findReferences`, and `disassembleProject` all run
through native tools end to end, no hand-rolled JS de/encoders left anywhere.

### Changed — native binutils disassemblers replace ALL the hand-rolled ones
Every hand-rolled JS instruction decoder (m68k / z80 / sm83) is **deleted** and
replaced by **native GNU binutils `objdump` compiled to WASM** — the same binutils
we already build per toolchain, now shipping `objdump` alongside
`as`/`ld`/`objcopy`. The JS decoders dropped real instructions and (on m68k)
desynced the byte stream into garbage — the "useless binary" a Genesis RE session
hit. There is **no JS fallback** — the native path is the only path.
- **m68k (Genesis)** → `m68k-elf-objdump`. The JS decoder dropped move-sr / muls /
  divu and mis-sized the fallback; a real ROM now disassembles cleanly.
- **Z80 (SMS / Game Gear / MSX)** → binutils z80 `objdump` `-m z80` (fixes the
  (ix+d)/(iy+d) displacement display + edge cases).
- **SM83 (Game Boy / Color)** → the same z80-elf `objdump` via its `gbz80` machine.
  One z80-elf binutils serves both CPU families.
- **ARM/Thumb (GBA)** → `arm-none-eabi-objdump`.

### Added
- **GBA disassembly** (the 14th platform, previously rejected) — `disassembleRom`
  and `findReferences` disassemble ARM7/Thumb via native `arm-none-eabi-objdump`
  (ARM by default, `thumb:true` for Thumb code).
- **`disassembleProject` now covers all 14 platforms, GBA included.** Each region
  disassembles through the CPU's native objdump and reassembles **byte-exact**
  through the matching native `as`/`ld`/`objcopy` (cc65 ca65/ld65 for 6502/65816).
  Any line the assembler won't reproduce exactly is healed to a `.byte` of its real
  bytes, so the round-trip is always byte-for-byte. The GBA project splits a 192-byte
  header data region from an ARM code region; it rebuilds byte-exact but reads low
  (most GBA C is Thumb reached via an ARM crt0 stub — ARM/Thumb mode-tracking is the
  readability follow-up).
- **Lynx** wired into `disassembleRom` + `findReferences` (65C02 via da65; strips the
  64-byte LYNX header, anchors at $0200).
- **Cheat search** now uses `fuse.js` over tag-stripped game names — adds
  character-level typo tolerance on top of the existing region/revision-tag and
  word-order robustness.

### Internal
- Native binutils 2.42 is built to WASM for THREE targets — `m68k-elf`,
  `arm-none-eabi`, and `z80-elf` (one serves both Z80 and gbz80) — each shipping
  `as`/`ld`/`objcopy`/`objdump`. Reproducible build scripts under `scripts/`
  (`build-m68k-wasm-tools.sh`, `build-arm-wasm-tools.sh`, `build-z80-binutils-wasm.sh`),
  pins in `scripts/versions.json`.
- Bumped binary packages this release: `romdev-toolchain-m68k-gcc` 0.2.0 (+ objdump),
  `romdev-platform-gba` 0.3.0 (+ ARM objdump), `romdev-toolchain-sdcc` 0.2.0
  (+ z80-elf binutils).

## 0.3.1

Homebrew/asset-import polish from a Genesis platformer session, plus a Genesis
sprite-inspection bug fix.

### Added
- **`wavToXgm2Pcm`** — convert a WAV (or raw s16le PCM) into a Genesis XGM2 PCM
  sample: 8-bit signed mono, 13.3 kHz (or 6.65 half-rate), 256-byte-padded, plus a
  256-aligned C array + `<NAME>_LEN` define ready to `#include` and `XGM2_playPCM`.
  Bakes in the fiddly sign/rate/alignment/padding rules.
- **`convertImageToTiles`** now takes `pngPath` (reads the PNG from disk — no base64
  token cost or hand-forwarding corruption) and `tileOrder:'sprite'` (column-major,
  the order multi-cell hardware sprites read on Genesis/Lynx).

### Changed
- **`imageToTilemap`** (Genesis) now warns when a visible dominant color is forced
  to palette index 0 (transparent on a scroll plane → renders as the backdrop).
- **`recordAudio`** description now cross-references `getAudioState` (WAV is to
  HEAR; getAudioState is to ASSERT), and notes getAudioState doesn't cover Genesis
  PCM-channel activity yet. Genesis MENTAL_MODEL documents the XGM2 PCM rules.

### Fixed
- **Genesis `inspectSprites` size/position** — a 32×32 sprite decoded as 8×8 (and
  x/y/tile/palette could be wrong) because the SAT words were read big-endian;
  gpgx stores VRAM host-little-endian (byte-swapped). Fixed in the live sprite,
  plane-preview, and which-tiles decoders.

## 0.3.0

The reverse-engineering / romhacking release — a full RE toolkit driven by a real
NBA Jam Tournament Edition (Genesis) session, plus PC Engine + MSX cheat coverage
and a cleaner package split.

### Added — RE / romhacking toolkit
- **`searchValue` / `searchNext`** — the iterative value-search loop (Cheat-Engine
  / RetroArch cheat search): seed candidate addresses for an on-screen value, then
  narrow with `eq`/`gt`/`lt`/`changed`/`unchanged`/`inc`/`dec` as the value changes.
  The bread-and-butter "find the address of X" primitive. Works on all 14 platforms.
- **`readCartRom`** — read the loaded cartridge ROM image to confirm a patch is
  actually running. For un-banked platforms (Genesis, GB/GBC, SMS/GG, PCE, Lynx,
  Atari, C64) a file offset equals the CPU ROM address; NES/SNES skip the header
  and flag `mapped:true` (bytes correct, mapper-banked).
- **`classifyRegion`** — heuristic ("looks like ascii-text / high-entropy /
  tile-data / structured-data") that flags when a "found table" is really an ASCII
  string, killing the coincidental-match trap before a broken patch ships.
- **`navigate`** — drive menus by advancing on SCREEN CHANGE instead of fixed frame
  waits, reporting per-press whether it was `consumed`. 5–10× faster, deterministic
  menu scripting.
- **`traceVramSource`** (Genesis) — report which ROM offset a VRAM graphic was DMA'd
  from (decoded from the VDP DMA registers). Answers "this name/logo is a
  pre-rendered bitmap — where in ROM is it?".
- **`searchCheats`** — fuzzy game-name search over the cheat DB (no full-DB dump).
- **ROM-hacking playbook** — cross-platform RE/patching decision tree, readable via
  `getPlatformDoc({platform:'romhacking', name:'playbook'})`.

### Added — platforms / data
- **PC Engine** and **MSX** cheat-database coverage (397 + 377 games).
- **`romdev_game_codes`** — the cheat database is now its own package (lazy-loaded one
  platform at a time), shrinking the main package while letting the DB grow
  independently. Still a required dependency, so `npx romdev-mcp` ships with cheats.

### Changed
- **`learnFontMap`** now detects and reports pre-rendered tile graphics
  (`likelyPreRenderedGraphic`) instead of failing silently on non-font "text".
- **`diffMemory`** defaults to a clustered summary (changed ranges + stride
  detection — "islands at stride 0x80 ⇒ likely a struct array") instead of dumping
  thousands of per-byte rows; `view:'raw'` for the exact list.
- **`findWriter` / `watchMemory`** now hint, on no per-byte write, that the region
  may be bulk-copied/DMA'd (sprite shadow, display list, VRAM) — watch the source
  struct, not the destination.
- **`screenshot`** with `inline:true` now also writes a temp PNG and returns its
  path, so follow-up ImageMagick crops don't ENOENT.
- **`gameCheats`** fuzzy-matches a ROM name to the DB (region/revision tag tolerant).

### Fixed
- **Genesis CRAM color decode** — colors rendered blue-on-black; the decoder now
  reads the packed 9-bit little-endian CRAM correctly.

## 0.2.0

- PC Engine and MSX added as Tier-1 platforms (14 total).
- Server/livestream show the version, sourced from `package.json`.
