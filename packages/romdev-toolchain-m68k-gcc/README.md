# romdev-toolchain-m68k-gcc

m68k-elf-gcc toolchain (cc1/as/ld/objcopy/objdump) for Sega Genesis C — and the
native m68k disassembler/reassembler behind `disassembleProject` — as WebAssembly.

A binary package for [romdev](https://github.com/monteslu/romdev) — it ships the
prebuilt WebAssembly + JS glue and is resolved by the main `romdev` package on
demand. You normally install `romdev`, not this package directly.

## Upstream & license

Bundles: **m68k-elf-gcc, binutils**.

**License:** GPL-3.0-or-later with GCC Runtime Library Exception (does not encumber compiled ROMs).

This package redistributes the upstream binary built to WebAssembly; the source
is fetched from a pinned upstream commit at build time (see the romdev repo's
`scripts/versions.json` and `BUILDING.md`). See the romdev repo `NOTICE` for the
full third-party inventory.

**Built by:** `romdevtools/scripts/build-m68k-wasm-tools.sh + build-sjasm.sh` (no patch — built clean). See `scripts/BUILD_MAP.md` in the romdev repo for the full recipe→package map.
