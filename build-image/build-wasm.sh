# Run a romdev WASM build inside the pinned Emscripten container - no local
# emcc/bison/flex needed, reproducible anywhere Docker runs.
#
# Usage:
#   build-image/build-wasm.sh build-dasm.sh          # run one build script
#   build-image/build-wasm.sh build-fceumm.sh
#   build-image/build-wasm.sh                        # interactive shell in the image
#
# The script that runs is one of the build-*.sh scripts (today they live in
# packages/romdev/scripts/ - wherever the build recipes end up, point
# SCRIPTS_DIR at them). The repo is bind-mounted at /work; build outputs land
# back on the host exactly as a local build would.
